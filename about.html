            This project is an unofficial "official" page for the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons do not currently have
            their own website, as it is hosted through the NBA. Here, we will compile the history, lay out the
            current roster of the players, and have a composite schedule for the upcoming games.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <div class="goals">
            <ul>
                <li>To apply knowledge gained on some of the fundamentals of Web Technologies, specifically, HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>To demonstrate understanding of design and functionality concepts as evidenced by a website that is
                    easy to navigate (user-friendly) and that presents the content (which should be relevant) in an
                    organized and cohesive manner.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <div class="requirements">
            <ol>
                <li>The midterm project should be an informational website or a collection of related web pages on a
                    topic of your choosing. We went with an unofficial "official" Detroit Pistons website.</li>
                <li>The project should have at least 5 HTML pages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One page named index.html which will represent the home page or landing page of your project. This
                            page must contain a navigation menu which will help users to navigate through your website.</li>
                        <li>One page named about.html with information about the web developers (this page). It must contain your
                            names, project team number, and a description of what your project is about. This page will serve as the
                            midterm project report.</li>
                        <li>One page named catalog.html which will list items (a composite calendar) with their details.</li>
                        <li>Create at least two other pages with content of your own choosing, which should be relevant to your
                            project topic. Here, we went with an athletic roster and a history page.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
