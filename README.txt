Include (in your README file) a summary of how you implemented requirements like  error handling, web security, and/or integration of web 
service(s) in your project, and in which files (and file sections) the relevant code can be found. 
You can also include comments about factors that influenced any major programming decisions you made (e.g. selecting between two approaches).
Include comments as appropriate to describe the purpose or function of sections of the code in each file, to make it easier to follow the code.
